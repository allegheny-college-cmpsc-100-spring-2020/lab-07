# Lab 7 reflection: Solution Repository

## This lab demonstrates `classes` and `objects`. Describe the difference between them using examples.

## Look at the following line of code. What are its parts and what does it do?

```java

```

## Paste the `constructor` of the `Die` class below. Describe the purpose of this method and how it works.

```java

```
### What does the `this` keyword do? Why is it important?

## In the code block below, copy and paste a `method` from `Die.java` that has a `return type`. Describe why its `return type` is appropriate.

```java

```

### For the `method` above, paste the statement from `HumanQuest.java` that "calls" it. What does it do?

```java

```

## For methods in `Die.java`, what's an example of a "getter?" A "setter?"


## What was your biggest technical challenge in this lab? How did you overcome it?
