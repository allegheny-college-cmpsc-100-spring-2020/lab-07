# CMPSC 100-02 Lab Session 7: HumanQuest, Part 1

* Assigned: 27 February 2020
* Due: 12 March 2020
* Point value: 45

During this session, we expand our knowledge about Java as an object-oriented language using `classes`, `methods`, and self-developed `reference types` to continue to practice and illustrate the underlying rules of our programming to date.

## General guidelines for laboratory sessions

* **Follow steps carefully.** Laboratory sessions often get a bit more complicated than their preceeding Practical sessions. Especially for early sessions which expose you to platforms with which you may not be familiar, take notes on `command`s you run and their corresponding effects/outputs. If you find yourself stuck on a step, let a TL or the professor know! Laboratory sessions do not mean that we won't help you in the same way we do during Practicals.
* **Regularly ask and answer questions.** Some of you may have more experience with the topics we're discussing than others. We can use this knowledge to our advantage. But, like in Practicals, let students try things for a while before offering help (**always _offer_ first**). To ask questions, use our [Slack](https://cmpsc-100-02-sp-2020.slack.com)'s `#labs` channel.
* **Store and transfer files using GitHub.** Various forms of file storage are more or less volatile. *You* are responsible for backing up and storing files. If you're unsure of files which have been changed, you can always type `git status` in the terminal for your working folder to determine what you need to back up.
* **Keep all of your files.** See above, but also remember that you're responsible for the files you create.
* **Back up your files regularly.** See above (and above-above).
* **Review the [Honor Code](https://sites.allegheny.edu/about/honor-code/) regularly when working.** If you're taking a solution from another student or the Internet at-large (_especially_ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)), bear in mind that using these solutions _can_ constitute a form of plagiarism that violates the Allegheny Honor Code. While it may seem easy and convenient to use these sources, it is equally easy and convenient to rely on them and create bad habits which include not attributing credit or relying exclusively on others to solve issues. Neither are productive uses of your intellect. Really.

## HumanQuest

![Intrepid? Hero?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allegheny-college-sandbox/cmpsc-100-spring-2020-lab-07/media/media/g-wiz-humanquest.png)

As a gator who falls prey to the latest trends sweeping the Gator Kingdom, G. Wiz and his friends Slippy Toad, Frogger, and Lyle Crocodile find themselves caught up in playing _HumanQuest_, a game in which the friends form a party and role-play mundane human jobs and tasks. After a marathon session over over 10 hours, the crew confronts a final challenge in the adventure and must defeat it or their party's work is doomed! They only have one chance, and they're relying on their luck for success.

* G. Wiz chose to play a `janitor`, and when they roll dice for any challenge, they use a four-sided die (`d4`)
* Slippy Toad plays a `middle manager`, and when they roll dice for challenges, they use a six-sided die (`d6`)
* Frogger, the practical one of the group, plays a `software developer` -- which uses an eight-sided die (`d8`)
* Lyle, a late-comer to the group, chose to play a `consultant`, a role which decides everything with a coin flip (`d2`)

In contrast, the challenge requires rolling _one_ die, the total sides of which are stored in the `quest.stats` file in the `input` directory as an integer. _The sum_ of all of the party's rolls must be greater than (not equal to) the difficulty of the challenge. Both the challenge difficulty and name have been provided to you in the above-referenced file. You must first read and store these values.

Each die must be an `instance` of class `Die` -- in which you will need to complete the code. The `HumanQuest.java` file scripts the encounter, and relies upon the `Die` `reference type` to do so.

You and your heroes will need the best of luck to overcome this challenge!

## Evaluation

### `HumanQuest.java`

- [ ] Contains no:
    * `TODO` markers
    * `{Your Name Here}` markers
- [ ] Scans input from the `input/quest.stats` file
- [ ] Creates the sufficient amount of `Die` objects to accommodate:
    * The challenge roll
    * G. Wiz's roll
    * Slippy Toad's roll
    * Frogger's roll
    * Lyle's roll
- [ ] Compares the _total_ of these rolls against the challenge's roll in order to determine a `true`/`false` value representing the party's defeat of the challenge "boss"
- [ ] Prints the result of each roll and matches the general output pictured here:

```
The party must beat the  Paper Jam's roll: 13
G. Wiz rolls: 1
Slippy rolls: 4
Frogger rolls: 7
Lyle rolls: 1
The party's total roll: 13
The party defeated the paper jam: false
```

### `Die.java`

- [ ] Contains no:
    * `TODO` markers
    * `{Your Name Here}` markers
- [ ] Implements a complete `constructor` method which:
    * Accepts 1 argument, an `int` parameter called `sides`
    * Sets `instance` ("global") variables `sides` and `random`
- [ ] Implements a complete `roll` ("setter") method which:
    * Takes no arguments
    * Assigns the `instance` ("global") variable `result` to the result of the `nextInt` of the class' `Random` object-oriented
- [ ] Implements a complete `getRoll` ("getter") method which:

```

## GatorGrader

### A note about `gradle`

`gradle` is a program which manages our program's many moving parts. It coordinates building, testing, compiling, and running our code -- tasks that will become more complex over the course of the semester in direct proportion to the complexity of our programs. There are three "tasks" that we will use extensively in this course.

#### `gradle build`

`gradle build` compares code against a set of convetions ("best practices") for creating legible code. There are many different standards for doing this, but our department chooses to follow the [Google Style Guide for the Java language](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). This includes such rules as:

* Each "level" of code being indented by 2 spaces
* Not using single-letter identifiers
* Enforcing consistent use of "Javadoc" (and other) comments
* ... and more!

These kinds of standard make reading code much easier, and help folks like our Technical Leaders (and me) read your code to figure out where something isn't going as planned.

#### `gradle run` (and its variants)

`gradle run` (and its counterpart `gradle -q --console plain run`) compile and run our Java programs. Once again, this will become more handy when we start to build projects that require _multiple_ files.

#### `gradle grade`

`gradle grade` runs the GatorGrader application. This application uses grading standards _specific to an assignment_. This means that the grading files created when you accept an assignment are the same ones by which I will evaluate your work: _once you've cloned an assignment, they do not change_.

You will use this command to grade your work before you turn it in, enabling you to know before I grade it what your grade will be.

#### Running GatorGrader directly on `container` start

- [ ] `cd` to your `CMPSC100` folder
- [ ] Locate the `cmpsc-100-spring-2020-lab-07` folder and `cd` to it.
    * Remember that if you run `ls -la`, you should see a `.git` folder if you're in the main repository folder.
- [ ] To make sure you're in the right repository, type `pwd` and press `Enter`
    * If you recieve the expected path, you're in the right place!

```
docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target="/project" --hostname GatorGrader gatoreducator/dockagator
```

#### Run `gradle` commands in the container`

```
docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target="/project" --hostname GatorGrader gatoreducator/dockagator bash
```

- [ ] To `build` your Java work, type `gradle build` at the `command` prompt and press the `Enter` key.
- [ ] To `grade` your Java work, type `gradle grade` at the `command` prompt and press the `Enter` key.

## Submitting the assignment/saving progress

The GitHub platform is a place to store your work. So, it makes some sense that should be able to _clone_ (download) from it, and push back (upload) to it. Here, we'll learn this second part.

- [ ] `cd` to your `CMPSC100` folder
- [ ] Locate the `cmpsc-100-spring-2020-lab-07` folder and `cd` to it.

Once in this folder, we need to tell git that there have been changes.

- [ ] Type `git add .` and press `Enter`
* This tells git to look through the _entire_ folder structure for new changes and "stage" them

- [ ] Type `git commit -m "{Commit message}"` to "label" the commit
* This is typically something like `git commit -m "Fixing a typo"` -- the message in quotes should be as descriptive as possible, while still remaining somewhat short

- [ ] To send all changes to the server, type `git push`
- [ ] At the prompt, input the password associated with the `SSH Key` you created earlier in this exercise (yesterday)

Once the process finishes successfully, we're done!
